TO-DO and random thought list.
==============================
* [IN PROGRESS] Add downloads and install for cmake and dmake  programs, used in several package compilations (dmake especially for Perl) - unpack into /mingw directory.
* [DONE] sort out the support unpack routines to only unpack the files we are needing, and all into the same directory, no subdirs.
* Further upgrade the above unpack routines to add an 'everything-but' option and options to ignore specific internal directories etc.
* Provide backup scripts to save specified directories and files before a new run of the bootstrap (envisioned to save CPAN mirrors, downloaded packages etc) 
* Add functionality to work through a proxy.

After base system complete :
----------------------------
Change over from running the dev system using a cmd file to a compiled TinyPerl script, with configuration file for tweaking -adding env variables and path editions, etc.
