TO-DO and random thought list.
==============================
* Provide backup scripts to save specified directories and files before a new run of the bootstrap (envisioned to save CPAN mirrors, downloaded packages etc)
* [IN PROGRESS] Replace the current MinGW packages with self-compiled versions.
* add existing ssh keys - copy from template to /home if they exist. If none, offer to create these on first run of dev shell.

After base system complete :
----------------------------
+ Change over from running the dev system using a cmd file to a compiled TinyPerl script, with configuration file for tweaking -adding env variables and path editions, etc.
+ Switch bootstrap to run in graphical env using GTK+, still with perl. If can be compiled as option above then so much the better. Would make it much easier to control configuration of bootstrap and dev system.
* Provide self-extracting installer for the completed bootstrap system.

User selected Additions :
-----------------------
+ Automatically install pre-compiled versions of Perl, Ruby & Git as required (chosen in bootstrap config)
+ Ruby (if installed) : Option to automatically install a list of standard gems, update system etc.
+ Perl : Option to automatically update CPAN and install standard modules (difficult since so many need manual tweaking on windows), start a local cpan mirror and more.
