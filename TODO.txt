TO-DO and random thought list.
==============================
* Provide backup scripts to save specified directories and files before a new run of the bootstrap (envisioned to save CPAN mirrors, downloaded packages etc)
* Add functionality to work through a proxy. Different needs for the dev and for the bootstrap - latter just needs entries in the .wgetrc, while former needs full shell support (ENV variables etc).
* Add configuration file support for the bootstrap scripts first and then for the dev environment itself.
* Remove all MinGW packages that are compiled with dw2, replace with self-compiled versions.

After base system complete :
----------------------------
+ Change over from running the dev system using a cmd file to a compiled TinyPerl script, with configuration file for tweaking -adding env variables and path editions, etc.

User chosen Additions :
-----------------------
+ Automatically install pre-compiled versions of perl, ruby, git as required (set from config)
+ Ruby (if installed) : Option to automatically install a list of standard gems, update system etc. 
+ Perl : Option to automatically update CPAN and install standard modules, start a local cpan mirror and more.
