TO-DO and random thought list.
==============================
Add downloads and install for cmake and dmake  programs, used in several package compilations (dmake especially for Perl) - unpack into /mingw directory.
sort out the support unpack routines to only unpack the files we are needing, and all into the same directory, no subdirs.


After base system complete :
----------------------------
Change over from running the dev system using a cmd file to a compiled TinyPerl script, with configuration file for tweaking -adding env variables and path editions, etc.
